1.	On disas the binary we can see that there is a function 'o' and 'n'. We understand that we neeed to call function 'o' with a format string attack.
2.	After the printf call in function 'n', the progran will exit(). We can modify the address of exit with the adress of function 'o' using the forma %n principle.
3.	python -c 'print "<exitAddress_inLittleEndian>" + "<%functionO_addInIntp-4bytes> + "%<positionOf_argN>$n""'
